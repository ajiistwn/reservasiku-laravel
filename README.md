# About Reservasiku

My reservation web application is an online reservation web. This web consists of two main parts, namely the business part and the part where in this part a businessman or property owner can add the property he owns and start his business, and the user part where in this part the user can search and rent the place he likes easily, which is combined into one complete web unit. making this web application a multi-role web application whose code is centralized, structured, and easy to manage.
